ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brad Tramel, a twenty-something wordsmith turned frontend developer. Before web development, my professional life had been an amalgam of side gigs. I wrote about Halloween costumes, waxed poetic about Hearthstone â€” even detoured to law school. No, seriously!

- ðŸ’­ When I learned Javascript, I knew I had found my professional spark. Coding challenged me to solve real-world problems, scratched my creative itch, and empowered me to learn constantly.

- ðŸ’» Since then I have re-learned Flexbox and Grid, plumbed the depths of Javascript, scratched the surface of React, and toyed with a few CSS frameworks while following The Odin Project's open-source Full Stack Javascript curriculum. 

- ðŸ“± I built run-of-the-mill apps like to-do lists, games, and weather UIs, but challenged myself to extend them -- learning about and implementing local storage, asynchronous code, responsive design, and more. I finished more daunting projects, like a React and Material UI web app that recommends attractions using Google Maps API.

- ðŸŒ± In the meantime, if you need me, I'll be off building something. (Good odds I could be playing chess, cooking tacos, or managing a fantasy sports team, too.)

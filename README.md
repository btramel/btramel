👋 Hi, I’m Brad Tramel, a writer and project manager turned frontend developer. I thrive at turning designs into engaging digital experiences.

- 🐺 Since September 2022 I have been a front end developer for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx. I help manage a sprawling development environment spanning multiple Wordpress and React sites. Meanwhile, I translated thousands of lines of code from GatsbyJS to NextJS, designed and built a component library, and developed <a href="https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/badnight">microsites</a> for <a href="https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/canvas">many</a> digital marketing <a href="https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/lookbooks/wolves-women-the-wild-collective">efforts</a>.

- 🌱 In the meantime, if you need me, I'll be off building something. (Good odds I could be playing chess, cooking tacos, or managing a fantasy sports team, too.)

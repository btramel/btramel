👋 Hi, I’m Brad Tramel, a wordsmith turned frontend developer. Before web development, my professional life had been an amalgam of side gigs. I wrote about Halloween costumes, waxed poetic about card games — even detoured to law school.

- 💭 When I learned Javascript, I knew I had found my professional spark. Coding challenged me to solve real-world problems, scratched my creative itch, and empowered me to learn constantly.

- 🐺 Since September 2022 I have been a front end developer for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Lynx. I help manage a sprawling development environment spanning multiple Wordpress and React sites. Meanwhile, I translated thousands of lines of code from GatsbyJS to NextJS, built out a component library, and developed <a href="https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/badnight">microsites</a> for many digital marketing <a href="https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/canvas">efforts</a>.

- 🌱 In the meantime, if you need me, I'll be off building something. (Good odds I could be playing chess, cooking tacos, or managing a fantasy sports team, too.)
